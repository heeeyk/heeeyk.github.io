I am currently a Master candidate in the School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Techonology, advised by [Prof. Zhijing Yang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38512188800). I also collaborate with [Dr. Yongyi lu]([https://ykshi.github.io/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rIJ99V4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)). Before that, I received my B.E. degree in the Collage of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Techonology. 

Research interest: AI for medical(Image segmentation, Depth of anesthesia forecasting), Data-efficient learning, Diffusion, NeRF.
